# ====== Stroke Prediction Model ======
Dataset Source: [Healthcare Dataset Stroke Data](https://www.kaggle.com/asaumya/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data) from Kaggle.

This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, and various diseases and smoking status. A subset of the original train data is taken using the filtering method for Machine Learning and Data Visualization purposes.


About the Data: 
Each row in the data provides relavant information about a person , for instance; age, gender,smoking status, occurance of stroke in addition to other information
Unknown in Smoking status means the information is unavailable.
N/A in other input fields imply that it is not applicable.

The Objective of this Project is to Create a model with 100 % F1 Score and AUC = 1, so the model is perfectly able to distinguish between positive class (have stroke) and negative class (not have stroke). If you want to see more detail and final deployment of this project, click the link below :
